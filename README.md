**Learning Github with Python Challenges.**

Posting my Python code answers to the challenges in Karan's Projects Repo.
Coding and posting on Github for learning purposes.

*This repo is basically a copy of [Karan's projects.](https://github.com/karan/Projects) I realize the redundancy in creating my own repo. Donate to his Repo and send him all the praise for his work.*
